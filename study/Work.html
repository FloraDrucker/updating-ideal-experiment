    You were selected into the {{ percent_ideal }} percent of participants who now <b>have to do the number of tasks they said they ideally want to do.</b> Therefore, you have to do <b>{{ ideal_to_do }} tasks to complete the last part.</b> You stated this amount as ideal in the {{ part_ideal_elicited }}. Please note that if you <b>do not complete all {{ ideal_to_do }} tasks</b> within the {{ work_length_minutes }} minutes, you <b>will not receive any payment for your work</b> if this part is chosen for payment. If you finish the {{ ideal_to_do }} tasks before the time is up, the <b>remaining time will count as non-work time.</b> You will still have to respond to the attention checks to get payment for the non-work part as well.
