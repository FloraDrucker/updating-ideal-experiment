    The {{ work_length_minutes }} minutes of work will start on the next page. {{ if player.round_number == 2 }} In this part and all consecutive parts, <b>you can also choose to stop working at any time</b> and switch to the non-work activity (e.g. using your smartphone). If one of these parts is selected at the end of the study for payment, you will be paid based on your <b>performance in the task</b> (earning {{ if treatment }}the true payoff{{ else }}{{ true_benefit }} points{{ endif }} per task) and <b>minutes spent on the non-work activity</b> (earning the flat fee of {{ flat_fee }} points per minute).

<p> You were <b>NOT selected into the {{ percent_ideal_total }} percent</b> of participants who are required to complete their ideal amount of tasks. Therefore, <b>everything remains identical to previous parts</b>. </p>

{{ elif player.do_ideal == True }}

<p>
    You were <b>selected into the {{ percent_ideal_total }} percent</b> of participants who now <b>have to do the number of tasks they said they ideally want to do.</b> Therefore, you have to do <b>{{ ideal_to_do }} tasks to complete the last part.</b> You stated this amount as ideal in the {{ part_ideal_elicited }}. Please note that if you <b>do not complete all {{ ideal_to_do }} tasks</b> within the {{ work_length_minutes }} minutes, you <b>will not receive any payment for your work</b> if this part is chosen for payment. If you finish the {{ ideal_to_do }} tasks before the time is up, the <b>remaining time will count as non-work time.</b> You will still have to respond to the attention checks to get payment for the non-work part as well.
