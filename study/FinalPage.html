<p> Thank you for participating in this study. Your payment from the study is as follows:

    <ul>
        <li> You receive the <b>completion fee of {{ completion_fee }}</b>. </li>
        <li> For your payment for the task, the computer has selected {{ task_chosen_part }} randomly, in which you completed {{ performance_in_chosen_part }} tasks. The fixed payoff per task was {{ true_payoff }} points, so you will receive <b>{{ payoff_for_work }} points = {{ payoff_for_work_usd }} for your work.</b></li>
        <li> You spent {{ leisure_minutes }} minutes on the <b>outside options</b>, so you receive <b>{{ leisure_payoff }} points = {{ leisure_payoff_usd }}</b> for this part. </li>
        <li> The randomly chosen part for payment for your beliefs about the true benefit is part {{ belief_chosen_part }}, and your guess was {{ belief_in_chosen_part }} in this part. Your <b>payment for your beliefs is {{ payment_for_belief }}</b>. </li>
        <li> You receive <b>{{ payment_for_risk }} points (= {{ payment_for_risk_usd }}) from the lottery decision</b>, because the randomly selected decision  was {{ chosen_risk_question }}, where you chose {{ choice_in_risk_question }}. </li>
    </ul>

</p>

<p> Your total payment is therefore {{ total_payment }} for the study. </p>

<p>
    You will receive your payment within 3 days via the Prolific payment system.
