<p>
    This online study consists of a trial and five parts. In each part, you will have to make some decisions and complete a simple task. You will earn <b>a flat payment of {{session.config.participation_fee}}</b> if you complete the whole study, <b>plus an extra income</b> that depends on your decisions and performance in one of the six parts (five main plus trial), which is chosen at random by the computer. <b>The average additional income can amount to {{C.AVG_ADD_INCOME}} or more, but is likely to be substantially less depending on your decisions and performance.</b>
</p>
<p>
    All payments will be made within three days via the Prolific payment system after you have finished the whole study.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Each part will last ten minutes, and the entire study should take no longer than {{C.TOTAL_DURATION}} minutes.</b> In between the different parts, we will ask you to answer a few questions.
</p>

<p>
    On the following pages, we will describe the task you will have to do and the study in detail.
