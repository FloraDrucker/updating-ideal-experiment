    This online study consists of five parts and a trial. In each part, you will have to make some
    decisions and complete simple tasks. You will earn a flat payment of {{session.config.participation_fee}}
    if you complete the whole study, plus an extra income that depends on your decisions and performance
    in one of the six parts (five main plus trial) randomly chosen by the computer.
</p>

<p>
    Each part will last around ten minutes, and the whole study will last around {{C.TOTAL_DURATION}} minutes.
    In between the different parts, we will ask you to answer a few questions.
</p>

<p>
    The average additional income will be around {{C.AVG_ADD_INCOME}}. All payments will
    be made within three days via the Prolific payment system after you have finished the whole study.
