    In the trial and in all five consecutive parts, you will work on the task you just saw for at most eight minutes. You will receive <b> a fixed payoff {{ if not player.treatment }} of {{ C.TRUE_PAYOFF }} points {{ endif }} </b> for each correctly solved encryption task in the part that will be randomly chosen for payment. {{ if player.treatment }} Right now, you only know that the payoff is <b> between {{ C.BENEFIT_RANGE_MIN }} and {{ C.BENEFIT_RANGE_MAX }} points </b> per task. {{ else }} Besides working on the encryption task, you have an additional task to do: we chose <b> a number between {{ C.BENEFIT_RANGE_MIN }} and {{ C.BENEFIT_RANGE_MAX }}</b>, and you will have to guess this number. {{ endif }}
</p>

    <p>Each part of the study will have the following stages:</p>

<h5> 1. Guessing the {{ guess_about }} </h5>

<p>
    In all parts except for the trial, you will have to <b>state how large you think the {{ guess_about }} is</b> based on your current information. You can earn a <b>bonus payment of {{C.BELIEF_BONUS}} points if your guess</b> in the randomly chosen part <b>is close to the true {{ guess_about }}.</b> The more precise your guess – i.e., the closer it is to the true {{ guess_about }} -, the more likely it is that you win {{C.BELIEF_BONUS}} points. Given this payment rule, <b>you should state your best guess</b> to ensure the largest chance of receiving the {{C.BELIEF_BONUS}} points. If you are interested in the exact mathematical formula stating the precise payment rule, please click on the button “Show mathematical formula”.

        The probability of receiving the payment is

    <script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.4/MathJax.js?config=default'></script>
    {{ if player.treatment }}
    $$ {p = 1- \frac{(\text{your guess} - \text{actual payoff per task})^2}{900}.} $$
    {{ else }}
    $$ {p = 1- \frac{(\text{your guess} - \text{actual chosen number})^2}{900}.} $$
    {{ endif }}

    <p>
        If your guess equals the actual {{ guess_about }}, then p=1, and you will get the extra payment for sure. The further your guess deviates from the actual {{ guess_about }}, the lower is the probability p that you receive the extra payment. If your guess deviates from the actual {{ guess_about }} by more than 30, then p=0, i.e., p can never turn negative.
    </p>

<br>

<h5> 2. Further information about the {{ guess_about }} </h5>

<p>
    During the course of the study, you will get more and more information that will allow you to obtain more precise knowledge of the {{ guess_about }}. This will work in the following way: The {{ guess_about }} is <b> the average of 150 numbers</b> that lie <b>between {{ C.BENEFIT_RANGE_MIN }} {{ if player.treatment }}points{{ endif }} and {{ C.BENEFIT_RANGE_MAX }}{{ if player.treatment }} points{{ endif }}.</b> The same number can occur several times. <b>At the beginning of parts two to four,</b> we will briefly <b>display 50 of these 150 numbers</b> (represented by balls) on the screen. Each of the 150 balls will be displayed only once, so <b>you will have seen all the balls after part four.</b>
</p>

<script>
    function toggleMathFormula() {
        const section = document.getElementById('mathFormula');
        const button = event.target;
        if (section.style.display === 'none') {
            section.style.display = 'block';
            button.textContent = 'Hide mathematical formula';
        } else {
            section.style.display = 'none';
            button.textContent = 'Show mathematical formula';
        }
    }
</script>

<br>

<h5> 3. Working on the encryption task </h5>

<p>
    After receiving the information about the {{ guess_about }}, you will <b>work on the task for eight minutes.</b> Your payment for the encryption task will be <b>{{ if player.treatment }}the fixed payoff {{ else }} {{C.TRUE_PAYOFF }} points {{ endif }}times the number of tasks you completed correctly.</b>
</p>
    <p>
    However, you do not have to work for the full eight minutes. At any point during the eight minutes, <b>you can stop working on the encryption task</b> by clicking on the "Stop working" button and go to any non-work activity that you wish to do (e.g., using your smartphone) instead for the remainder of the 8 minutes. You will receive a flat fee of <b>{{ C.FLAT_LEISURE_FEE }} points for every minute in the non-work activity</b> as long as you show you are still active in the assignment by completing <b>attention checks.</b> To do this, you need to <b>click a button that pops up roughly once every 60 seconds</b> and remains on the screen for 5 seconds. If you fail to click the button before it disappears, you will receive a warning message. If you fail more than one attention check, you will not get paid for the non-work activity in that part. Please note that <b>once you decide to stop working, you will NOT be able to return to the encryption task in this part.</b>
</p>

    <h5> 4. Questionnaire </h5>

<p>
    Between each consecutive part, we will ask you to answer a few questions.
</p>

    <br>
    <br>

<h4> Payment for the study </h4>

<p>
    Your final payoff will come from <b>five sources:</b>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>A fixed <b>completion fee of {{ participation_fee }}</b> if you complete the whole study.</li>
    <li>Payoff from your <b>performance in a part randomly chosen by the computer</b> (including the trial): number of tasks completed times {{ if player.treatment }}the true payoff per task{{ else }} {{C.TRUE_PAYOFF }} points{{ endif }}. Note that if you have to do your ideal amount of tasks in the fifth part but fail to do them and this part gets selected for payment, you will not be paid for your performance. </li>
    <li> <b>{{ C.FLAT_LEISURE_FEE }} points per minute spent on the non-work activity</b> in the same randomly chosen part. Note that you only receive payment for the non-work activity if you fail no more than one attention check. </li>
    <li><b>Bonus payment based on the accuracy of your guess</b> about the {{ guess_about }} in another part randomly chosen by the computer (from parts 1 to 5).</li>
    <li>In one of the questionnaires between two parts, you will make a <b>lottery decision</b>. At the end, you will also get paid based on this decision.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    All payments will be converted from points to USD at a rate of <b>1000 points = {{ thousand_points }}.</b>
</p>
