<p>
    In the trial and in all five consecutive parts, you will work on the task you just saw for at most 10 minutes. You will receive <b> a fixed payoff {{ if not player.treatment }} of {{ C.TRUE_PAYOFF }} points {{ endif }} </b> for each correctly solved encryption task in the part that will be randomly chosen for payment. {{ if player.treatment }} Right now, you only know that the payoff is <b> between {{ C.BENEFIT_RANGE_MIN }} and {{ C.BENEFIT_RANGE_MAX }} points </b> per task. {{ else }} Besides working on the encryption task, you have an additional task to do: we chose <b> a number between {{ C.BENEFIT_RANGE_MIN }} and {{ C.BENEFIT_RANGE_MAX }}</b>, and you will have to guess this number. {{ endif }}
</p>

<p>
    After the trial, at the beginning of the first part, we will ask you to state how many tasks you would <b>ideally want to do</b> within the 10 minutes <b>{{ if player.treatment }}for different levels of the task payoff{{ else }}for {{C.TRUE_PAYOFF }} points per task{{ endif }},</b> given your experience with the trial task and the alternative options you have. Additionally, we will ask you to <b>predict how many tasks you {{ if player.treatment }}would actually do</b> for these payoff levels{{ else }}will actually do{{ endif }}</b>. There is a {{ C.PERCENT_IDEAL }}% chance that in part 5 you will have to do as many tasks as you stated as ideal {{ if player.treatment }}for the payoff per task {{ endif }}. {{ if player.treatment }}Should the true payoff per task be different from the payoffs for which you stated your ideal work amounts, we will extrapolate the ideal amount of work at the true payoff level from your answers.{{ endif }} With {{ percent_normal }}% probability, however, you will be able to complete as many tasks as you want in part five, too.
</p>

    <br>

    <p>Then, each part of the study will have the following stages:</p>

<h5> 1. Guessing the {{ guess_about }} </h5>

<p>
    In all parts except for the trial, you will have to <b>state how large you think the {{ guess_about }} is</b> based on your current information. You can earn a <b>bonus payment of {{C.BELIEF_BONUS}} points if your guess</b> in the randomly chosen part <b>is close to the true {{ guess_about }}.</b> The more precise your guess – i.e., the closer it is to the true {{ guess_about }} -, the more likely it is that you win {{C.BELIEF_BONUS}} points. Given this payment rule, <b>you should state your best guess</b> to ensure the largest chance of receiving the {{C.BELIEF_BONUS}} points. If you are interested in the exact mathematical formula stating the precise payment rule, please click on the button “Show mathematical formula”.

<div id="mathFormula" class="border rounded p-3 mt-3 mx-auto" style="display: none; width: 80%; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
    <p>
        The probability of receiving the payment is
    </p>

    <script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.4/MathJax.js?config=default'></script>
    {{ if player.treatment }}
    $$ {p = 1- \frac{(\text{your guess} - \text{actual payoff per task})^2}{900}.} $$
    {{ else }}
    $$ {p = 1- \frac{(\text{your guess} - \text{actual chosen number})^2}{900}.} $$
    {{ endif }}

    <p>
        If your guess equals the actual {{ guess_about }}, then p=1, and you will get the extra payment for sure. The further your guess deviates from the actual {{ guess_about }}, the lower is the probability p that you receive the extra payment. If your guess deviates from the actual {{ guess_about }} by more than 30, then p=0, i.e., p can never turn negative.
    </p>
</div>

<br>

<h5> 2. Further information about the {{ guess_about }} </h5>

<p>
    During the course of the study, you will get more and more information that will allow you to obtain more precise knowledge of the {{ guess_about }}. This will work in the following way: The {{ guess_about }} is <b> the average of 120 numbers</b> that lie <b>between {{ C.BENEFIT_RANGE_MIN }} {{ if player.treatment }}points{{ endif }} and {{ C.BENEFIT_RANGE_MAX }}{{ if player.treatment }} points{{ endif }}.</b> The same number can occur several times. <b>At the beginning of parts two to four,</b> we will briefly <b>display 40 of these 120 numbers</b> (represented by balls) on the screen. Each of the 120 balls will be displayed only once, so <b>you will have seen all the balls after part four.</b>
</p>

<script>
    function toggleMathFormula() {
        const section = document.getElementById('mathFormula');
        const button = event.target;
        if (section.style.display === 'none') {
            section.style.display = 'block';
            button.textContent = 'Hide mathematical formula';
        } else {
            section.style.display = 'none';
            button.textContent = 'Show mathematical formula';
        }
    }
</script>

<br>

<h5> 3. Working on the encryption task </h5>

<p>
    After receiving the information about the {{ guess_about }}, you will <b>work on the task for 10 minutes.</b> Your payment for the encryption task will be <b>{{ if player.treatment }}the fixed payoff {{ else }} {{C.TRUE_PAYOFF }} points {{ endif }}times the number of tasks you completed correctly.</b>
</p>
    <p>
    However, you do not have to work for the full 10 minutes. At any point during the 10 minutes, you can stop working on the encryption task by clicking on the "Stop working" button and go to the non-work activity instead for the remainder of the 10 minutes. You will receive a flat fee of <b>{{ C.FLAT_LEISURE_FEE }} points for every minute </b>in the non-work activity as long as you show you are still active in the assignment by completing attention checks. To do this, you need to click a button that pops up roughly once every 60 seconds and remains on the screen for 5 seconds. If you fail to click a button before it disappears, you will receive a warning message. Please note that <b>once you decide to stop working, you will NOT be able to return to the encryption task.</b>
</p>
    <p>
    From the second to the fifth part, before asking about your guess regarding the {{ guess_about }}, we will <b>first remind you of how many tasks you completed correctly in the previous part.</b> In the fifth part, you will not receive any new information about the {{ guess_about }} anymore, but you will still have to guess it and work on the encryption task.

</p>

    <h5> 4. Questionnaire </h5>

<p>
    Between each consecutive part, we will ask you to answer a few questions.
</p>

    <br>
    <br>

<h4> Payment for the study </h4>

<p>
    Your final payoff will come from <b>five sources:</b>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>A fixed <b>completion fee of {{ participation_fee }}</b> if you complete the whole study.</li>
    <li>Payoff from your <b>performance in a randomly chosen part:</b> number of tasks completed times {{ if player.treatment }}the true payoff per task{{ else }} {{C.TRUE_PAYOFF }} points{{ endif }}.</li>
    <li> <b>{{ C.FLAT_LEISURE_FEE }} points per minute spent on the non-work activity</b> in the same randomly chosen part.</li>
    <li><b>Bonus payment based on the accuracy of your guess</b> about the {{ guess_about }} in a randomly chosen part.</li>
    <li>In one of the questionnaires between two parts, you will make a <b>lottery decision</b>. At the end, you will also get paid based on this decision.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The computer will <b>randomly choose a part</b> from the trial and the five main parts that will determine your <b>payoff from the task and the alternative options.</b> It will choose <b>another part randomly</b> from the five main parts (which can be the same as or different from the one first chosen) that will determine your <b>payoff for your guess</b> about the {{ guess_about }}. All payments will be converted from points to USD at a rate of <b>1000 points = {{ thousand_points }}.</b>
</p>
