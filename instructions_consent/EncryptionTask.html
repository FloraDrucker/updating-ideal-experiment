    In all parts of the study, you will work on a simple task. In this task, you have to <b>encrypt letter combinations (=”words”) into numbers,</b> based on the key you see at the bottom of the page. Please see a screenshot of the task below.

    In this example, the letter “W” corresponds to the number 411, “A” to 133, “F” to 331, and “Z” to 162, so you have to type 411, 133, 331, and 162 into the boxes below the letters, respectively. You can <b>submit your response by clicking the Submit button</b> below the task. If any of the entries are incorrect, the computer will tell you the number of entries that are wrong, but not which ones are wrong. Then you will be able to revise your solution. Once the correct numbers are entered, after clicking the Submit button, you will see a new word to encrypt. After each correctly solved task, the computer generates a new encryption key. The order of the letters in the key is also shuffled between the tasks.
