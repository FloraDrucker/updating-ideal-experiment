<p>
    In all five parts, you will work on the task you just saw for at most 10 minutes. You will receive a fixed payoff for each correctly solved encryption task in the part that will be randomly chosen for payment. The payoff is between 25 cents and 75 cents per task. Every part will have the following stages:
</p>

<br>

<h5> 1. Guessing the true payoff of the task </h5>

<p>
    You will have to state a number for how large you think the fixed payoff per correctly solved task is based on your current information. You will receive a bonus payment of {{C.BELIEF_BONUS}} if your guess in the randomly chosen part is close to the true task payoff. The more precise your guess about the fixed task payoff is – i.e., the closer it is to the true fixed payoff for each correctly solved task -, the more likely it is that you win x. Given this payment rule, you should state your best guess to ensure the largest chance of receiving the x.

    <p>
        You will have to guess the actual payoff per task at the beginning of each part. The closer your guess is to the actual payoff, the higher the probability that you receive an extra payment of
        {{C.BELIEF_BONUS}}.
    </p>

    <p>
        The probability of receiving the payment is
    </p>

    <script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.4/MathJax.js?config=default'></script>

    $$ {p = 1- \frac{(\text{your guess} -- \text{actual task payoff})^2}{B},} $$

    <p>
        where B (={{C.SCALING_PAR}}) is a scaling parameter that ensures probabilities remain between 0 and 1.
    </p>

    <p>
        In each part, we will draw a new, random number. Each number between 0 and 1 will be equally likely. If the randomly drawn number is smaller than or equal to p (the probability that you will receive the extra payment for your guess), you will receive the extra payment of {{C.BELIEF_BONUS}}. If the randomly drawn number is larger than p, you will not receive the extra payment.
    </p>

<h5> 2. Further information about the true payoff per task </h5>

<p>
    During the course of the experiment, you will get more and more information that will allow you to obtain more precise knowledge of this fixed payoff. This will work in the following way: The fixed payoff is the average of 120 numbers that lie between 25 cents and 75 cents. The same number can occur several times. At the beginning of parts 1 to 4, we will briefly display 30 of these 120 numbers (represented by balls) on the screen. Each of the 120 balls will be displayed only once, so you will have seen all the balls after part 4.
</p>

<script>
    function toggleMathFormula() {
        const section = document.getElementById('mathFormula');
        const button = event.target;
        if (section.style.display === 'none') {
            section.style.display = 'block';
            button.textContent = 'Hide mathematical formula';
        } else {
            section.style.display = 'none';
            button.textContent = 'Show mathematical formula';
        }
    }
</script>

<h5> 3. Working on the encryption task </h5>

<p>
    After receiving the information about the fixed payoff, you will work on the task for a maximum of 10 minutes. Your payment for this stage will be the fixed payoff times the number of tasks you completed correctly. However, you do not have to work for the full 10 minutes. We will offer you some alternatives that you can access via different links at the bottom of the page. For each minute spent on one of the alternatives, you will receive a flat fee of [x] cents.
</p>

<p>
    After the first part, we ask you to answer a few questions before we move on to the next part.
</p>

<br>

<h5> In the first part </h5>

<p>
    At the beginning of the first part, we will ask you to state how many tasks you would ideally want to do within the 10 minutes at different levels of the task payoff, given your experience with the trial task and the alternative options you have. Additionally, we will ask you to predict how many tasks you would actually do for these different payoff levels. There is a 5 percent chance that you will have to do as many tasks as you stated as ideal for the true payoff level in the fifth part. With 95 percent probability, however, you will not learn the true payoff yet, and you will be able to complete as many tasks as you want in part 5.
</p>

<br>

<h5> From the second part onwards </h5>

<p>
    xxx From the second to the fifth part, we will first remind you of how many tasks you completed correctly in the previous part. In the fifth part, you will not receive any new information about the fixed payoff (stage 2), but you will have to guess it (stage 1) and work on the encryption task (stage 3).
